# MatchaScripts
## Random shell/python scripts I do for fun and for learning !

Feel free to use them and edit them, but I would love it if you could mention me, or credit me!

## Here's what you need to know about my scripts:
- All my scripts are either Shell(zsh or bash, bash occasionally,batch rarely) or Python.
- Errors in my scripts are hard to find, doesn't mean you wouldn't find them at all.
- I am still learning both python and shell, so if I have used a inefficient technique to do something in my code, It would help tons if you reached out to me about it.
- Scripts are appended with a -shellscript or -pythonscript text respectively, next to the version number.

That's about it, really. Thanks for checking my repo out!!
